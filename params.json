This means that you have an inventory and access to the remost system via SSH with keys.\r\n\r\n1. Add the remote system to your Ansible's `hosts` (`/etc/ansible/hosts`) file to the group `[home-assistant}`.\r\n2. For every system you want to manage, you need to have the master's SSH key in the *authorized_keys* file of the managed/remote system.\r\n\r\nFrom the management system for the user **root**:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo ssh-copy-id -i /home/[your local user]/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@[IP address of remote system]\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Perform a first check if Ansible works:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nansible home-assistant -m ping\r\n192.168.1.2 | success >> {\r\n    \"changed\": false,\r\n    \"ping\": \"pong\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor further details about the setup of Ansible, check their [documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/).\r\n\r\nRole Variables\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n- **ha_venv**: The location of the virtual environment. Defaults to `/opt/home-assistant`\r\n- **ha_user**: The user for Home Assistant. Defaults to `ha`.\r\n- **ha_port**: The default port which is 8123.

They were made especially for the deployment of Home Assistant.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n\r\nAuthor Information\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n[Fabian Affolter](https://github.com/fabaff).
